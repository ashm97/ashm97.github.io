Welcome! I am an Applied Mathematics PhD student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) working between the [Department of Infectious Disease](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/infectious-disease) and the [EPSRC Centre for Mathematics of Precision Healthcare](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics-precision-healthcare). I am a data scientist by training with a background in computer science, but I have just enough expertise in infectious disease and epidemiology to make some trouble. My [research](research) and broader interests are all around generating data-driven insight into disease, and in my PhD I am exploring [Antimicrobial Resistance](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance#:~:text=What%20is%20antimicrobial%20resistance%3F,spread%2C%20severe%20illness%20and%20death.) (AMR) using complex networks.

## Current research motivation

Typically, well-known molecular drivers are cited to explain the rise of modern AMR. The selective pressures generated by our increased use of antimicrobials (including antibiotic drugs) is common amongst these, whereby only resistant organisms survive exposure to antimicrobials. Whilst an important factor, it is solely responsible, with much of the current research failing to explain the complex patterns of AMR emerging and persisting.

AMR does not occur in single individuals or isolated environments alone, but is unfolding over a highly interconnected and dynamic world. All these interactions between individuals facilitate AMRs spread, already we can see the movement of AMR both within countries and between countries ... AMR respects no borders!

My approach to AMR is to capture and understand this spread by looking at the structure of movement and interactions of individuals carrying it. Networks naturally capture this, and have recently shown great insight to a range of spreading phenomena, but not yet detailed in AMR. Hence, I'm working to explore what networks can tell us about AMR!
