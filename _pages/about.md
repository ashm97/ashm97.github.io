Welcome! I am an Applied Mathematics PhD student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) working between the [Department of Infectious Disease](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/infectious-disease) and the [EPSRC Centre for Mathematics of Precision Healthcare](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics-precision-healthcare). I am a data scientist by training with a background in computer science, but I have just enough expertise in infectious disease and epidemiology to make some trouble. My research, teaching, and broader interests are all grounded in generating data-driven insight into disease, using all the new developments coming from Complex Networks and Machine Learning. 

## Research

My [research](research) is currently focused on Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR) and is [funded](funding) by several research bodies. Already, AMR poses one of the greatest risks to human health with an esimtated 700,000 deaths worldwide from AMR realted infections each year. With this number expected to rise to 10 Million by 2050, the need for .. cannot be understated

In addition to AMR I have worked on several other projects, all aimed at generating data-driven insight into disease: including the [NHS](https://www.nhs.uk/) response to Covid-19; rapid infection diagnostics with [DSTL](https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/defence-science-and-technology-laboratory); and distributed computing to annotate the human genome with the [Computational Biology Facility](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/computational-biology-facility/).
