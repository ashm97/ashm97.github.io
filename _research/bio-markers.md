A fundamental problem for disease treatment is that while antibiotics are a powerful counter to bacteria, they are ineffective against viruses. Without the correct equipment, doctors can incorrectly prescribe antibiotics to patients without bacterial infections. This is especially hazardous for soldiers, and civilians caught in conflict, who often lack access to proper means of diagnosis. To provide support, I used a genetic algorithm to search a large dataset of human blood infection studies for signatures which could provide an accurate diagnosis of infection type. These discovered signatures and associated models are now being used in a portable prototype device, providing a rapid diagnosis to support field operations.
