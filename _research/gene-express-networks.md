Multivariate feature selection can often be a black box. This is especially the case in gene expression data, where thousands of features are considered in combination. Using only model statistics, one has little insight into the process driving predictive capability of feature sets. To provide direct insight, I investigated how underlying networks guide the process of feature selection in gene expression data. In the biological context, this can be extremely useful in finding the key groups of genes driving a given disease state. In the modelling perspective, this provides a visually interpretable means to explore feature selection of high dimensional data.

> Do rebels target civilians as part of the process of establishing control in their territories? This research note shows that transition periods after rebels gain territorial control are remarkably violent for civilians. Speaking to the civilian victimization and rebel governance literature, we investigate the immediate time period after rebels successfully capture and hold territory. We argue that rebels use violence to gain compliance in newly captured territories until they are able to build up local capacities and institutions for peaceful governance. To test this argument, we draw on methodological advances in integrating event data and combine multiple datasets to study patterns of violence perpetrated by the Revolutionary United Front in Sierra Leone from 1997-2001. The findings of our spatiotemporal analysis show that civilian targeting increases in the period after rebels capture territory from the government compared to areas without territorial takeover, suggesting that life under the roof of rebels is initially more dangerous for civilians.

William G. Nomikos and Rob Williams. "The Effects of UN Peacekeeping on Civilian Victimization: Evaluating Microlevel Evidence."

> Peacekeeping operations are among the most visible and impactful of United Nations activities. These missions have proven effective at protecting civilians in both active conflicts and post-conflict societies. However, recent research suggests that United Nations peacekeepers do not protect civilians equally from all types of violence. Peacekeepers require the consent of the government to gain access to specific areas of the state's territory, and so must balance their need for access with their duty to protect civilians from state-perpetrated violence. We employ microlevel data to explore where different types of peacekeeping personnel are deployed within conflicts and how these decisions affect the overall effectiveness of United Nations efforts to protect civilians.
