> Itâ€™s been 4 months since the first case pneumonia from unknown cause was reported to the WHO China Office. 

First detected in the city of Wuhan in Hubei province, this was the start of a pandemic caused by a novel coronavirus disease to be labelled as Covid-19. Since then a wave of Covid-19 has swept over the world, leaving few countries untouched, and hitting European countries especially hard, including here in the UK. 

Although hospitalisations rates are relatively low, Covid-19â€™s ease of spread makes it especially challenging for modern healthcare systems. Not designed to cope with such large waves of patients requiring hospitalisation and intensive care many health systems are beginning to strain. 

At the forefront of this fight in the UK is our NHS healthcare workers who are doing phenomenal work even when lacking essential resources. However, just behind this frontline are computer modellers glued to computer screens trying to offer glimpses into the various possible future. These insights are essential for planning and without them, many hospitals would likely be un-prepared and overrun with Covid-19 infected patients.

I first heard about Covid-19 in January whilst coincidentally sitting in on a meeting with ProMED aimed at developing tools to detecting emerging infectious disease; and three weeks ago I jointed the epidemiology team in Imperialâ€™s NHS trust to help fight this Covid-19 pandemic. Now, Iâ€™m joining daily conference calls via teams from quanrantine in my countryside home. 

As part of this group of Mathematicians, Epidemiologists, and Doctors; Iâ€™ve been working to forecast one- and two-week pictures of what realistic scenarios will be for Imperialâ€™s NHS Trust. Itâ€™s essential to tailor these forecasts to specific hospitals and bring in experts that understand both the mathematical models and the operational needs of each hospital, as the picture of COVID-19 across the UK can vary hugely.

Working alongside the NHS in this pandemic situation has highlighted the need for interdisciplinary teams linking experts key in the fight against infectious disease. Itâ€™s amazing being in this maths-epi-operations team where weâ€™re all building off each otherâ€™s strengths. I hope coming out of this, we are all pushed to interrogate more interdisciplinary teams into the world of pandemic response.

Iâ€™m grateful for all the support from the Medical Research Foundation for enabling me to help the NHS whilst Iâ€™m studying on their Antimicrobial Resistance themed PhD program. With all the skills Iâ€™m learning in and around infectious disease modelling Iâ€™m keen to see just how I can port them to fighting antimicrobial resistance once Covid-19 is behind us.
