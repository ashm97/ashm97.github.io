Contact tracing is a key tool in epidemiology to identify and control outbreaks of infectious diseases. Existing contact tracing methodologies produce contact maps of individuals based on a binary decision on contact which can be hampered by missing data and indirect contacts. Here, present our recent [paper](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.07.21254497) which  present our Spatial-temporal Epidemiological Proximity (StEP) model to recover contact maps in disease outbreaks based on movement data.
