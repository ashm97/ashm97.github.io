Contact tracing based on patient overlaps is widely used in hospital epidemiology to analyse outbreaks of healthcare-associated infections. However, missing data and indirect contacts can pose challenges to this methodology resulting in misleading conclusions. Here I presented methodology that mitigates these problems by defining a similarity between network-constrained temporal trajectories of patients, and analysing the ensuing patient trajectory similarity graph.
